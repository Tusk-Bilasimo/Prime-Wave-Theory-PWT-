Prime Wave Theory (PWT) Repository
Welcome to the Prime Wave Theory (PWT) GitHub repository! PWT is a protoscientific framework exploring the universe through the lens of prime numbers, harmonic cascades, and reciprocal duality. Inspired by the PWT Thesis V6, this repo hosts code tools to model PWT concepts, from variable gravity predictors to DNA prime signature analyzers and interactive periodic tables highlighting harmonic signatures. Our goal is to foster community collaboration, turning PWT's insights into interactive, testable explorations of quantum harmonics, cosmic scaling, negentropy in biology, and beyond.
For more context, check out the PWT.life blog, including posts like Variable Gravity Through the PWT Lens, PWT Prime-Driven Order in Biology and Consciousness, and the series on chemical elements: Unveiling Chemical Insights: Harmonic Prime Signatures, Harmonic Resonances: Grouping Elements, and Elemental Stability Through Harmonic Lenses, which reference tools here.

Installation
To run the tools locally:

Clone the repo:
Install dependencies (Python 3.12+ recommended):
For Jupyter notebooks: pip install notebook (or jupyterlab for advanced use).
For interactive runs: Open Jupyter with jupyter notebook and load .ipynb files.
Note: Some tools (e.g., DNA analyzers) fetch data from NCBI—replace Entrez.email in the code with your real email to avoid rate limits.

Usage
This repo includes Python scripts and notebooks for PWT simulations. Key files:

dna_prime_analyzer.py: Analyzes DNA sequences for prime signatures in codon counts, simulates evolutionary drifts to model negentropy. For details, see the blog post PWT Prime-Driven Order in Biology and Consciousness.
Run: python dna_prime_analyzer.py
Customize: Edit accession/start/end for different genes.
PWT_DNA_Prime_Analyzer.ipynb: Interactive Jupyter version for browser-based experimentation—run it online via Binder!
