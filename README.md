# Prime-Wave-Theory-PWT-
Prime Wave Theory (PWT) is a speculative, protoscientific framework that posits prime numbers as the fundamental scaffolding of reality. It proposes a universe structured by a principle of reciprocal duality, where the macrocosm of cosmic scales is governed by the outward progression of primes, and the microcosm of quantum mechanics.
