Abstract
Prime Wave Theory (PWT) is a speculative, protoscientific framework that posits prime numbers
as the fundamental scaffolding of reality. It proposes a universe structured by a principle of
reciprocal duality, where the macrocosm of cosmic scales is governed by the outward progression
of primes, and the microcosm of quantum mechanics is governed by the inward progression of
their reciprocals, or “harmonics.” This thesis outlines the theory’s core postulates and presents
a series of compelling numerical correlations in fundamental physics. The empirical cornerstone
of PWT is the discovery of a validated, predictive pattern in the fine-structure of hydrogen
called the Harmonic Cascade, where the prime signatures of quantum energy levels descend
through the foundational primes 5, 3, and 2. The theory is extended to provide a prime-based
model for the observed variability of the gravitational constant, G, suggesting gravity itself is
an emergent property rooted in the prime signatures of matter. PWT is presented not as a re-
placement for established physics, but as a new lens for pattern-finding that reveals a profound,
self-consistent symmetry across all scales of the universe.
